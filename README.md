Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial wanted to address security concerns for their financial service, this required some changes, code review, testing, certificate generation, and more.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think I made changes to the code that accurately and effectively removed security vulnerabilities or at the very least lessened them. It's important to code securely so that not as many changes need to be made when going back to the project and that information is not leaked at any point which could cause losses.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I think the hardest part of the whole project was weirdly enough just getting Maven to run the thing properly.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased the layers of security by changing the protocol from http to https, from verifying inputs, and some other things.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I used the Maven dependency check to see if there were any additional vulnerabilities added.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Knowing how to edit pom.xml files, how to check dependencies, that sort of stuff could be pretty useful in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I could show employers the skills I learned from this course and that I at the very least know the basics of security and ensuring anything I code is secured properly.
